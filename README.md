## From the Desk of a Serverpod Developer Advocate

Hello, fellow devs! I'm Amy, a passionate Developer Advocate of Serverpod. I'm thrilled to share **Magic Recipe**, the culmination of my journey through the comprehensive [Serverpod Academy](https://academy.serverpod.dev/)! This project demonstrates how Serverpod empowers you to build robust, scalable, and type-safe applications with incredible ease.

## üç≤ About Magic Recipe

**Magic Recipe** is an innovative application built to explore and solidify core Serverpod concepts while showcasing a practical use case: **AI-powered recipe generation from ingredients you provide!**

Beyond its core function, this project also demonstrates how to:
* **Generate recipes from a list of ingredients** using the Google Gemini API.
* Implement robust **user creation and management**.
* Provide a foundational **admin dashboard** for managing application data and users.
* Define and manage complex data models (`Recipe`, `User`).
* Handle efficient database interactions with PostgreSQL.
* Serve a responsive web frontend built with Flutter.
* Utilize caching for performance optimization.
* And much more, demonstrating a truly full-stack Dart experience!

This project specifically focuses on the powerful backend logic and its seamless, type-safe integration with a Flutter web client.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get your own **Magic Recipe** project up and running locally, follow these simplified steps. For a detailed, step-by-step guide, including how to set up your Gemini API key, I highly recommend going through the [Serverpod Academy](https://academy.serverpod.dev/) itself!

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hakierka/magic_recipe.git](https://github.com/hakierka/magic_recipe.git)
    cd magic_recipe
    ```
2.  **Start Docker services:**
    Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
3.  **Run the Serverpod server:**
    Navigate to the server directory and run the Serverpod server.
    ```bash
    cd magic_recipe_server
    serverpod generate # (if you've changed definitions)
    serverpod run
    ```
4.  **Build and run the Flutter web client:**
    From the `magic_recipe` root, build and serve the Flutter app.
    ```bash
    cd .. # Back to magic_recipe root
    chmod +x ./scripts/build_flutter_web # Make the build script executable
    ./scripts/build_flutter_web         # Build and copy web assets
    flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080 # (Or your preferred Flutter run method)
    ```
    *(Note: Your Flutter app needs to connect to the Serverpod running on its specified port, typically 8080 or 8081 for the Serverpod server's web API)*.
